In Maltese Invasion, the player controls a dog that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the dog
right and left using the arrow keys, and bite using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a few dogs fills the screen and moves across
and down the screen. The player bite the dogs and scares them.
If the player scares all the dogs, a new group dogs appears that moves
faster than the previous group. If any dogs hits the player's dog
or reaches the botom of the screen, the player loses one live.
If the player loses three lives, the geme ends.
(Maybe there will be a collection of bones.)
